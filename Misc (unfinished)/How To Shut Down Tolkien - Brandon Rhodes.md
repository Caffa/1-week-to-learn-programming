# [How To Shut Down Tolkien - Brandon Rhodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVlqBxpCG24)

Having an audience transforms your writing (prgramming).

A Critic (feedback loop).

People tend to have harsher criticism of finished work.

passages values most by the writer tend to be valued least by the reader. Readers care more for clarity rather than cleverness.

**An Audience. A Critic. A Deadline.**
